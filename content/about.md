Hello there! I am Subhabrata Choudhury. I did my undergrad in metallurgy at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kharagpur">IIT Kharagpur</a> in India a couple of years back. After my brief stint in finance at <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America">Bank of America</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://flextrade.com/about/">Flextrade Systems</a>, I moved to Germany and joined <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saarland_University">Saarland University</a> to complete my masters in computer science. Currently, I am in the UK as a PhD student at the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. I love music, theatre and arts; and suck spectacularly at all of them. I love travelling and photography.
